# Lanzarote TL;DR:

Lanzarote is the third most populous Canary Island, after Tenerife and Gran Canaria. Decades ago its target was low-cost all-inclusive mass tourism, but the island went through quite a bit of gentrification in recent years, due to its stunning natural gifts and cultural heritage of its famous sculptor/architect Cesar Manrique. It's not the best if you are on a budget (go to Fuerteventura) or if parties are your main focus (go to Tenerife or Gran Canaria). Lanzarote is perfect for couples that value good work/life balance and want to spend time outdoors. Especially if you have small kids: it's incredibly safe, clean & convenient.
