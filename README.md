# Lanzarote TL;DR:

Lanzarote is the third most populous Canary Island, after Tenerife and Gran Canaria. Decades ago its target was low-cost all-inclusive mass tourism, but the island went through quite a bit of gentrification in recent years, due to its stunning UNESCO-protected natural gifts and vast cultural heritage of its famous sculptor/architect [Cesar Manrique](https://www.google.com/search?q=cesar+manrique&source=lnms&tbm=isch). It's not the best if you are on a budget (go to Fuerteventura) or if parties are your main focus (go to Tenerife or Gran Canaria). Lanzarote is perfect for couples that value a healthy lifestyle and want to spend time outdoors. Especially if you have small kids: it's incredibly safe, clean & convenient.

## Internet

Canary Islands have long been a hub for submarine telecommunications cables running from mainland Europe to Africa and South America. Due to good geography they are home to a number of (https://www.go-astronomy.com/observatories-canary-islands.php)[observatories] producing heaps of data every night. These two facts combined mean that the archipelago has suprisingly good internet connection, all things considered. The main limitation to get fast speed are the local providers.

On Lanzarote, most developed areas got fibre in recent years. Which forced the 4G providers to remove GB limits and modernize their networks. While it was somewhat tricky to get good broadband ~5 years ago, today unlimited broadband is everywhere where there are tourists. The vast majority of villas and apartments have either FTTH or fast 4G, some are still on slower ADSL. Check before you book.  

If you are a EU citizen, you can probably use your SIM without major charges. Alternatively, you can get a prepaid SIM card at one of the three main providers:
* [Movistar](https://www.movistar.es/particulares/movil/tarifas-moviles/tarjeta-sim-prepago/) (20€: 75GB, valid for one month)
* [Vodafone](https://www.vodafone.es/c/particulares/es/productos-y-servicios/movil/prepago-y-recargas/tarifas-de-prepago/tarifa-prepago-l/) (20€: 70GB, valid for one month)
* [Yoigo](https://www.yoigo.com/tarifas-tarjeta) (20€: 16GB, valid for one month)

All three use the same infrastructure, so there are no major differences in speed and coverage. They all have multiple shops around the island, use your favorite mapping software to find them.

## Coworking

2020 sawy a huge influx of remote workers coming to Lanzarote. The local [Digital Nomads & Remote Workers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/lanzarotedigitalnomads) Facebook group is bustling with activity and recommendations and they keep an updated list of [digital workers friendly places](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?fbclid=IwAR0K706pmaXW7SnxTq3QqIbTfGGUf1a8C6Tk-hN2VMYdpc_WTTvgnnd833g&mid=1dFPBvTmbgFVEqMyrbZ9ss4KxIeodHeMm&ll=29.04262030608178%2C-13.591215089555734&z=10).

There are two coworking places: [The Square](The Square) and [Espacio Siono](https://www.facebook.com/espaciosiono-104063281156848/), both in Arrecife, the capital of the island. There was another one, [Lanzarote Coworking](http://www.lanzarotecoworking.com/en), that sadly had to close.

Most villas and appartments provide broadband Internet, here's a list of a few that even have fiber: https://fiber-optic-accommodations.com/spain/canary-islands/lanzarote/

# Live

## Three main resort areas

### Puerto del Carmen

The first and today the biggest resort town on Lanzarote. Lots of hotels, villas, restaurants, shops. Very touristy feel. Long beachside promenade with lots of people doing various sports. Right at the end there is Puerto Calero, a fancy marina with upmarket villas, but no beach and not much to do if you don't have a car.

### Playa Blanca

Even more resort-y than Puerto Del carmen, and also quite far away from everything so not ideal if you plan to explore the island. Still, has everything you need if you don't plan to wander around. Gets the most sunshine on the island. 

### Costa Teguise

Smaller than Puerto del Carmen ("PDC") but much better local vibe. Its smaller size makes it very convenient, if you stay in the central "Las Cucharas" area, everything is walkable: beaches, supermarkets, pharmacies, restaurants, playgrounds, international school, etc. Recently renovated beachside promenade with outside gyms and playgrounds. Best location to explore the island, shortest distance to most sights. Higher chance of being windy than the other two, which is somewhat mitigated by the buildings being oriented in a way to block the wind.

## Less mainstream areas

### Famara

A surfing village with a huge sandy beach. Bohemian vibe, sandy streets, lots of young people learning to surf in numerous surf schools. Definitely an interesting experience, but could be too much for families with small kids, especially for longer stays. Often windy and somewhat cloudy.

### Arrieta / Punta Mujeres

Two small fishing villages, absolutely beautiful, amazing scenery, good local restaurants, but somewhat non-central location so not great for exploring the island. Often windy and gets some clouds.

### Arrecife

The capital of the Island. Busy narrow streets, very local and authentic feel. Great for young single people wanting to learn Spanish.

## Getting around

There is an OK bus network on lanzarote: https://lanzaroteinformation.co.uk/lanzarote-buses-0/

But if you at all can, rent a car. From Costa Teguise, for example, most things to do are 20 to 30 minutes of driving away. Roads are good, the locals drive slow  and renting can be as cheap as 100€ per week -- gasoline is cheap too. [Payless](https://www.payless.es/) and [Autoreisen](https://autoreisen.com/) are the two most popular local providers of rentals.

## Groceris

International chain stores such as Spar, Lidl (best for dairy products), Mercadona (fantastic fish) and IKEA are on the outskirts of Arrecife, 10 minutes drive from Costa Teguise, 20 minutes from Puerto del Carmen and Famara. 

There are two local supermarket chains also work visiting: Roper and Chacon. Both have a wide selection of high-quality local meat & fish products, cheese, beers wines, etc.

Even though Lanzarote is a semi-desert, the soil is very fertile and local farmers grow amazing vegetables all-year-round. If you have a car, the best place to buy local produce is [Fruteria Los Molinos](https://www.facebook.com/Costateguisefruteria/) and [Lanzafruit](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lanzafrut+S.L./@28.9696263,-13.5632467,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xc46276dfda829d3:0x154ca56d0a4c41a!8m2!3d28.9694586!4d-13.5612172). Alternatively, you can order home delivery with [Huerto Canario](https://huertocanario.es/) -- they drive to the farms to collect everything and drop a box of goodness at your doorstep. 

## Weather

Lanzarote is called the island of eternal spring. The usual attire all-year-round are flip-flops, shorts and a good hoodie. The Atlantic ocean acts as a temperature regulator: the water temperature is always around 20°C which makes sure that the air temperature is stable too: it oscilates between 18°C in the winter and 25°C in the summer. It's rarely cold or hot. Most days of the year, it's "just right" for light clothes and no need for heating or A/C. That said, you need a good hoodie or a hat to block the wind. 

Take care of your skin, use sun screen with a high factor. 

## Dangerous animals

There are none. 

No snakes, no venomous spiders, no predators, no big game. The occasional annoying mosquito, but nothing compared to summer in mainland Europe. No malaria or zika. Very little bees, wasps even rarer. 

The ocean is teeming with wildlife, watersports enthusiasts regularly see dolphins, whales, flying fish, turtles, even sharks. Most areas around the island are UNESCO protected and cannot be fished. This seems to keep the wildlife happy and humans safe. There hasn't been a shark attack in over 50 years. 

Some years a fleet of jellyfish floats by the island, keeping swimmers on land for a few days. 

By FAR the most dangerous thing on the island are ocean currents. DO NOT GO INTO THE WATER if there are no lifeguards on duty. Serisously, do not. People die every year. The ocean is very strong, and waves come in groups. One minute you can be totaly fine, walking knee-deep in the water on a beautiful sandy beach and the next thing you know you get knocked over by a river of whitewater and sucked out into the impact zone. Again, people die every year, even whole families, when parents run in to save their kids. Please be careful, only go near the ocean on lifeguard protected beaches (Costa Teguise, Puerto del Carmen, Famara, ...).
