# Lanzarote TL;DR:

Lanzarote is the third most populous Canary Island, after Tenerife and Gran Canaria. Decades ago its target was low-cost all-inclusive mass tourism, but the island went through quite a bit of gentrification in recent years, due to its stunning natural gifts and cultural heritage of its famous sculptor/architect Cesar Manrique. It's not the best if you are on a budget (go to Fuerteventura) or if parties are your main focus (go to Tenerife or Gran Canaria). Lanzarote is perfect for couples that value good work/life balance and want to spend time outdoors. Especially if you have small kids: it's incredibly safe, clean & convenient.

## Internet

Canary Islands have long been a hub for submarine telecommunications cables running from mainland Europe to Africa and South America. Due to good geography they are home to a number of [observatories](https://www.go-astronomy.com/observatories-canary-islands.php) producing heaps of data every night. These two facts combined mean that the archipelago has suprisingly good internet connection, all things considered. The main limitation to get fast speed are the local providers.

On Lanzarote, most developed areas got fibre in recent years. Which forced the 4G providers to remove GB limits and modernize their networks. While it was somewhat tricky to get good broadband ~5 years ago, today unlimited broadband is everywhere where there are tourists. The vast majority of villas and apartments have either FTTH or fast 4G, some are still on slower ADSL. Check before you book.  

If you are a EU citizen, you can probably use your SIM without major charges. Alternatively, you can get a prepaid SIM card at one of the three main providers:
* [Movistar](https://www.movistar.es/particulares/movil/tarifas-moviles/tarjeta-sim-prepago/) (20€: 75GB, valid for one month)
* [Vodafone](https://www.vodafone.es/c/particulares/es/productos-y-servicios/movil/prepago-y-recargas/tarifas-de-prepago/tarifa-prepago-l/) (20€: 70GB, valid for one month)
* [Yoigo](https://www.yoigo.com/tarifas-tarjeta) (20€: 16GB, valid for one month)

All three use the same infrastructure, so there are no major differences in speed and coverage. They all have multiple shops around the island, use your favorite mapping software to find them.

## Coworking

* No good options, there was one, but they closed
* This is because families are here and people work from their villa/apartment, no need for a central coworking space to "hang out"
* You can work anywhere:
  * Cafes and restaurants are used to people with laptops

# Live

* Famara, Playa Blanca, Puerto del Carmen, Costa Teguise, Arrieta & Punta Mujeres, Other. 
* You need a car, at least every now & then.
* IKEA
* Weather & what to wear
* No dangerous/annoying animals
